Prerequisites
1. Download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2. Run `npm install` in root, to install dependencies
3. Start script

To start the script you can either:
- (Recommended) Using the `Run and Debug` built into VS Code
- Build and run manually
  - Build with `npx tsc`
  - Run with `node .\bin\index.js`
  - You can optionally run it with `node .\bin\index.js debug` to run it in debug mode
- Run using the VS Code task
  - Open with `Ctrl + Shift + P` and then calling `Run Task` and then `RUN`
  - Or with installing the [Tasks extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=actboy168.tasks), and clicking the `RUN` button at the bottom
